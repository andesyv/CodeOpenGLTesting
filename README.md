# OpenGL Testing

Just a small test repository for OpenGL. Unique with this repository is that it's made using Visual Studio Code, [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) and [Glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/). [ENTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) is also used for object handling.

Check out the space branch, that one is interesting.
